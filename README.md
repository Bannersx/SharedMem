# SharedMem
This is the first project in the Introduction to Operative Systems class
The objective is to be able to create a circular mailbox utilizing semaphores as
resource manager, allowing or stopping processes from accesing the shared memory 
based on the current state of the semaphore.
The main improvement available to the project current form is to add an extra semaphore
to make the consumer and producer proccesses independant from each other.
